Scala Hosting's VPS plans offer easy scalability, allowing you to increase your resources (CPU, RAM, storage) with minimal downtime. This ensures your streams can handle increasing numbers of viewers without performance degradation.

### Pricing:
Scala Hosting’s managed VPS plans start at around $14.95 per month for the entry-level plan, which includes 1 CPU core, 2 GB RAM, and 50 GB SSD storage.
